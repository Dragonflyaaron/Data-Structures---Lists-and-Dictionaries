# Data Structures: Lists and Dictionaries
Working with lists and dictionaries in Python to write a program for managing a caf√© inventory.

## Description
For this I imagined I am running Cafe.
I created a list (menu) that contained 4 items.
A dictionary called stock, which contained the stock value of each item.
I created another dictionary called price, which contained the price of each item.

Then I calculated total stock worth in the cafe
I did this by looping through the dictionaries 
Then print the results.

## Project Usage
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my abilities to work with list and dictionaries, 
as part of the HyperionDev Software Engineering Bootcamp and for potential recruiters.
