# Data-Structures---Lists-and-Dictionaries
Working with lists and dictionaries in Python to write a program for managing a caf√© inventory.

For this I imagined I am running Cafe.
I created a list (menu) that contained 4 items.
A dictionary called stock, which contained the stock value of each item.
I created another dictionary called price, which contained the price of each item.

Then I calculated total stock wirth in the cafe
I did this by looping through the dictionaries 
Then print the results.
